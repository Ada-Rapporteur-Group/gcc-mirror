/**
 * @file gupcr_broadcast.c
 * GUPC Portals4 broadcast implementation.
 *
 * The broadcast utility functions are internal functions used by
 * the UPC runtime when it is necessary to propagate (broadcast)
 * a value from thread 0 to all other threads.
 * For example, upc_all_alloc and upc_all_lock_alloc will
 * call the broadcast functions to propagate their result to all threads.
 *
 * The broadcast functions use an algorithm that is a variant of
 * the one used to implement a barrier.  The "up phase" signals
 * that each thread is ready to receive the broadcast value, while the
 * "down phase" is used to receive the actual value.
