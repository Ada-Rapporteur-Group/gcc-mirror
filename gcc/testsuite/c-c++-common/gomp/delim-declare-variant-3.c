/* Check that an error is diagnosed when a function defined in a
   "begin declare variant" construct doesn't have a visible declaration
   at that point.  

   The spec is not completely clear on this; it says the base function must be
   "declared elsewhere without an associated declare variant directive",
   without defining what "elsewhere" means.  Particularly in C++ it would be
   incorrect to inject such a declaration at the point of the variant
   definition (think of a variant for a class method that is defined with a
   qualified name outside of the class declaration, for instance).  The C++
   front end could differentiate between cases where base declaration injection
   is allowed vs not, but for now it seems simplest just to require that a
   definition always be visible.  */
