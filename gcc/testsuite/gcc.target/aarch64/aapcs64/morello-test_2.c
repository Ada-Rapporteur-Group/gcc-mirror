/* Test Morello-AAPCS64 layout  */

/* Differences between Morello and plain AAPCS64 are only when there are
   capabilities passed.

   Here we check Morello-AAPCS64 rule C.8 which states that capabilities and
   composites containing capabilities are passed in capability registers.
   This file tests that composite types containing capabilities are passed as
   expected.
  
   This testcase is part of a set.  morello-test_{2,3,4}.c test passing the
   same structures in different orders to ensure the behaviour is correct.  */
