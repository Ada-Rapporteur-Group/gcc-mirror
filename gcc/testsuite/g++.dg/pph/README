The test names have the following convention on the prefix of their
names.

    [acdpxy][12]*
    a - auxillary headers
    c - positive tests for c-level headers and sources
    d - negative tests for c-level headers and sources
    p - positive tests for what would be c-level code, but which
        due to C++ standard namespace games are not quite C level
        tests.
    x - C++-level positive tests.
    y - C++-level negative tests.
    1 - first priority feature tests
    2 - second priority feature tests

These prefixes are in lexical order with respect to the compilations.
That is, you must pick names in the right place in the build.
