The test names have the following convention on the prefix of their
names.

    [acdpxy][0-9]*

    a - auxillary headers
    c - positive tests for C-level headers and sources
    d - negative tests for C-level headers and sources
    e - C-level tests for non-sharable headers
    p - positive tests for what would be c-level code, but which
        due to C++ standard namespace games are not quite C level
        tests
    x - C++-level positive tests
    y - C++-level negative tests
    z - C++-level tests for non-sharable headers

    0 - tests with no pph inclusions (usually headers)
    1 - tests with a single leading pph file
    2 - tests with a nested leading pph files
    3 - tests non-leading pph files, but at most simple merging
    4 - tests non-leading pph files, with significant merging

    5 - tests with no pph inclusions plus C++stdlib merging
    6 - tests with nested leading plus C++stdlib merging
    7 - tests non-leading pph files plus C++stdlib merging

    8 - tests for secondary diagnostic features we would like to have
    9 - tests for tertiary diagnostic features we probably do not want

These prefixes are in lexical order with respect to the compilations.
That is, you must pick names in the right place in the build.

Tests labeled [567] are heavy iff the C++ standard library has been
built with PPH.
