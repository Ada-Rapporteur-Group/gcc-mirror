/* This is the primary interface class for the range generator at the basic
   block level. It allows the client to query a range for an ssa-name within
   a basic block, either on an outgoing edge, or on an individual statement. 
   
   It is lightweight to declare, but for each basic block that is queried, it
   will scan some or all of the statements in the block to determine what
   ssa-names can have range information generated for them.  THis will
   prevent constantly rescanning a block.
   
   THis is primarily of use to the path_ranger found in ssa-range.[ch] which
   builds on top of this to find ranges across the CFG.  */
