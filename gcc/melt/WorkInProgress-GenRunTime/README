MELT will very soon be able to generate most of the runtime support
for GTY-ed ctypes. Actually, some code is already working. But I am
not confident enought to install it now.

If you are brave, you could copy the *.c & *.h & Makefile.in files
here into the parent gcc/ directory.

The meltrunsup-inc.c & meltrunsup.h are generated files. You can then
[re-]generate them with make meltrun-generate in the gcc subtree of the
build directory. 

All this is alpha quality.

As soon as it works reliably, I will remove this
WorkInProgress-GenRunTime subdirectory.
