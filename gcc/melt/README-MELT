## file melt/README-MELT in melt-branch of GCC

The MELT web site is http://gcc-melt.org/

The files under melt/generated/ are all generated, but required to
compile and boostrap MELT. Somethimes, the make upgrade-warmelt target
is used to regenerate them.

Please read  http://gcc-melt.org/, 
and my GCC summit 2007 paper 
Multi-stage construction of a global static analyser by Basile Starynkevitch, pages 143 - 152
and my DSL2011 paper

This directory contains melt files. MELT is a dialect of Lisp compiled
into C code which should be compilable with the appropriate -fPIC and
-I options (perhaps using some melt-private-headers directory containing
the required *.h files from GCC source tree needed to compile the MELT
generated C code).

The MELT source files -a lisp like code- are *.melt and used to be
.bysl before April 9th 2009 (MELT branch rev 145716)

See the gcc/doc/melt.texi  file.
