==================== work098, patch #20

Make __float128 use the _Float128 type.

Currently GCC uses the long double type node for __float128 if long double is
IEEE 128-bit.  It did not use the node for _Float128.

Problems showed up if you call the nansq function to make a signaling NaN (nansq
is mapped to nansf128).  Because the type node for _Float128 is different from
__float128, the machine independent code converts signaling NaNs to quiet NaNs
if the types are  not compatible.  The following tests used to fail when run on
a system where long double is IEEE 128-bit:

	gcc.dg/torture/float128-nan.c
	gcc.target/powerpc/nan128-1.c

This patch makes both __float128 and _Float128 use the same type node.  If long
double is IEEE 128-bit, this patch makes the _Float128 and __float128 types to
be a variant of the long double type.

Improve converting between 128-bit modes that use the same format.

This patch improves the insns used for converting between two modes using
the 128-bit floating point format (i.e. converting between KFmode and TFmode if
-mabi=ieeelongdouble is used, and converting between IFmode and TFmode if
-mabi=ibmlongdouble is used).  The new insns have the correct insn type and
instruction length for the move involved.

Previously, the two different moves were lumped together (i.e. converting
between IEEE 128-bit and IEEE 128-bit was matched by the same insns as
converting between IBM 128-bit and IBM 128-bit moves).

==================== work098, patch #13

Rework 128-bit complex multiply and divide.

This function reworks how the complex multiply and divide built-in functions are
done.  Previously we created built-in declarations for doing long double complex
multiply and divide when long double is IEEE 128-bit.  The old code also did not
support __ibm128 complex multiply and divide if long double is IEEE 128-bit.

In terms of history, I wrote the original code just as I was starting to test
GCC on systems where IEEE 128-bit long double was the default.  At the time, we
had not yet started mangling the built-in function names as a way to bridge
going from a system with 128-bit IBM long double to 128-bin IEEE long double.

The original code depends on there only being two 128-bit types invovled.  With
some of the changes that I plan on making, this assumption will no longer be
true in the future.

The problem is we cannot create two separate built-in functions that resolve to
the same name.  This is a requirement of add_builtin_function and the C front
end.  That means for the 3 possible modes (IFmode, KFmode, and TFmode), you can
only use 2 of them.

This code does not create the built-in declaration with the changed name.
Instead, it uses the TARGET_MANGLE_DECL_ASSEMBLER_NAME hook to change the name
before it is written out to the assembler file like it now does for all of the
other long double built-in functions.

We need to disable using this mapping when we are building libgcc, which is
creating the multiply and divide functions.  The flag that is used when libgcc
is built (-fbuilding-libcc) is only available in the C/C++ front ends.  We need
to remember that we are building libgcc in the rs6000-c.cc support to be able to
use this later to decided whether to mangle the decl assembler name or not.

When I wrote these patches, I discovered that __ibm128 complex multiply and
divide had originally not been supported if long double is IEEE 128-bit as it
would generate calls to __mulic3 and __divic3.  I added tests in the testsuite
to verify that the correct name (i.e. __multc3 and __divtc3) is used in this
case.

==================== work098, patch #12

Add 'w' suffix for __ibm128 constants.

In the documentation, we mention that 'w' or 'W' can be used as a suffix for
__ibm128 constants.  We never implemented this.  This patch fixes that.

In addition, the 'q' and 'Q' suffix were changed to use the mode used for the
__float128 type, instead of knowing whether to use KFmode or TFmode explicitly.
This will be used in a future patch where we change the mode used for __float128
on systems where long double is IEEE 128-bit.

__ibm128 keyword and the __ibm128 built-in functions.  This patch fixes PR
