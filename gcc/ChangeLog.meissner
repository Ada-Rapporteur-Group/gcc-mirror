==================== Branch work199, patch #21 ====================

Use architecture flags for defining _ARCH_PWR macros.

For the newer architectures, this patch changes GCC to define the _ARCH_PWR<n>
macros using the new architecture flags instead of relying on isa options like
-mpower10.

The -mpower8-internal, -mpower10, -mpower11, and -mfuture options were removed.
The -mpower11 and -mfuture options were removed completely, since they were just
added in GCC 15. The other two options were marked as WarnRemoved, and the
various ISA bits were removed.

TARGET_POWER8, TARGET_POWER10, TARGET_POWER11, and TARGET_FUTURE were re-defined
to use the architeture bits instead of the ISA bits.

There are other internal isa bits that aren't removed with this patch because
the built-in function support uses those bits.

I have built both big endian and little endian bootstrap compilers and there
were no regressions.

Can I install this patch on the GCC 15 trunk?

==================== Branch work199, patch #20 ====================

Add rs6000 architecture masks.

This patch begins the journey to move architecture bits that are not user ISA
options from rs6000_isa_flags to a new targt variable rs6000_arch_flags.  The
intention is to remove switches that are currently isa options, but the user
should not be using this particular option. For example, we want users to use
-mcpu=power10 and not just -mpower10.

This patch also changes the target_clones support to use an architecture mask
instead of isa bits.

This patch also switches the handling of .machine to use architecture masks if
they exist (power4 through power11).  All of the other PowerPCs will continue to
use the existing code for setting the .machine option.

I have built both big endian and little endian bootstrap compilers and there
were no regressions.

In addition, I constructed a test case that used every archiecture define (like
_ARCH_PWR4, etc.) and I also looked at the .machine directive generated.  I ran
this test for all supported combinations of -mcpu, big/little endian, and 32/64
bit support.  Every single instance generated exactly the same code with the
patches installed compared to the compiler before installing the patches.

The only difference in this patch compared to the first version posted on
November 6th is that I the correct attribution and copyright year (i.e. that I
created rs6000-arch.def in 2024).

Can I install this patch on the GCC 15 trunk?
