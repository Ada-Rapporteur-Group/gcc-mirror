	PR target/71977
	PR target/70568
	* config/rs6000/predicates.md (sf_subreg_operand): New predicate
	that recognizes (SUBREG:SI (REG:SF)) and (SUBREG:SF (REG:SI)), so
	that these can be handled specially.
	(vlogical_operand): Reject sf_subreg_operand arguments.
	(gpc_nosf_reg_operand): New predicates that are like
	gpc_reg_operand and reg_or_cint_operand, but they do not allow the
	operand to match sf_subreg_operand.
	(reg_nosf_or_cint_operand): Likewise.

	* config/rs6000/rs6000.c (rs6000_emit_move): If we are moving a
	SFmode or SImode via a SUBREG, call special insns to do these
	moves using an explicit temporary.

	* config/rs6000/rs6000.md (UNSPEC_SF_FROM_SI): New unspec.
	(UNSPEC_SI_FROM_SF): Likewise.
	(zero_extendsi<mode>2): Fix typo in xxextractuw where we extracted
	the word from byte 1 instead of byte 4.
	(and<mode>3): Change all logical operations to reject SF subregs,
	and require an explicit copy of the subreg to a temporary.
	(and<mode>3_imm): Likewise.

	(lfiwzx): Fix typo in xxextractuw where we extracted the word from
	byte 1 instead of byte 4.
	(movsi_from_sf): New insnss to be explicit when we are using
	SFmode in subregs, where the value might need to be converted from
	the format used in the floatint point and vector registers to the
	format used in GPRs and in memory.
	(movdi_from_sf_zero_ext): Likewise.
	(movsf_from_si): Likewise.

	* config/rs6000/vsx.md (SFmode define_peephole2):  Allow the

	PR target/71977
	* config/rs6000/rs6000.md (sf_logical): New code iterator for
	optimizing logical operations on SFmode.
	* config/rs6000/vsx.md (SFBOOL_*): New constants for optimizing
	logical operations on SFmode.
	(SFmode define_peephole2): Recognize when we are moving a SFmode
	value from a vector register to a GPR, doing a simple logical
	operation on the result, and moving it back to a vector register
	and moving the logical operand to the vector registsrs, and do the
	boolean operation there.
