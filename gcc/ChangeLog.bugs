==================== Branch work198-bugs, patch #210 ====================

Fix PR 118541, do not generate unordered fp cmoves for IEEE compares.

This is version 6 of the patch.

In version 6 of the patch, I fixed some typos.

In version 5 of the patch, I added the 'class' keyword in declaring the
enumeration.

In versions 4 of the patch, I changed the use of enums to match current C++.

In version 3, I made the following changes:

    1:	The new argument to rs6000_reverse_condition that says whether we should
	allow ordered floating point compares to be reversed is now an
	enumeration instead of a boolean.

    2:	I tried to make the code in rs6000_reverse_condition clearer.

    3:	I added checks in invert_fpmask_comparison_operator to prevent ordered
	floating point compares from being reversed unless -ffast-math.

    4:	I split the test cases into 4 separate tests (ordered vs. unordered
	compare and -O2 vs. -Ofast).

In bug PR target/118541 on power9, power10, and power11 systems, for the
function:

        extern double __ieee754_acos (double);

        double
        __acospi (double x)
        {
          double ret = __ieee754_acos (x) / 3.14;
          return __builtin_isgreater (ret, 1.0) ? 1.0 : ret;
        }

GCC currently generates the following code:

        Power9                          Power10 and Power11

        blr

This is because ifcvt.c optimizes the conditional floating point move to use the
XSCMPGTDP instruction.

However, the XSCMPGTDP instruction will generate an interrupt if one of the
arguments is a signalling NaN and signalling NaNs can generate an interrupt.
The IEEE comparison functions (isgreater, etc.) require that the comparison not
raise an interrupt.

The following patch changes the PowerPC back end so that ifcvt.c will not change
the if/then test and move into a conditional move if the comparison is one of
the comparisons that do not raise an error with signalling NaNs and -Ofast is
not used.  If a normal comparison is used or -Ofast is used, GCC will continue
to generate XSCMPGTDP and XXSEL.

For the following code:

        double
        ordered_compare (double a, double b, double c, double d)
        {
          return __builtin_isgreater (a, b) ? c : d;
        }

        /* Verify normal > does generate xscmpgtdp.  */

        double
        normal_compare (double a, double b, double c, double d)
        {
          return a > b ? c : d;
        }

with the following patch, GCC generates the following for power9, power10, and
power11:

        ordered_compare:
                fcmpu 0,1,2
                fmr 1,4
                bnglr 0
                fmr 1,3
                blr

        normal_compare:
                xscmpgtdp 1,1,2
                xxsel 1,4,3,1
                blr

I have built bootstrap compilers on big endian power9 systems and little endian
power9/power10 systems and there were no regressions.  Can I check this patch
into the GCC trunk, and after a waiting period, can I check this into the active
older branches?

PR 99293: Optimize splat of a V2DF/V2DI extract with constant element

We had optimizations for splat of a vector extract for the other vector
types, but we missed having one for V2DI and V2DF.  This patch adds a
combiner insn to do this optimization.

In looking at the source, we had similar optimizations for V4SI and V4SF
extract and splats, but we missed doing V2DI/V2DF.

Without the patch for the code:

	vector long long splat_dup_l_0 (vector long long v)
	{
	  return __builtin_vec_splats (__builtin_vec_extract (v, 0));
	}

the compiler generates (on a little endian power9):

	splat_dup_l_0:
		mfvsrld 9,34
	        mtvsrdd 34,9,9
		blr

Now it generates:

	splat_dup_l_0:
		xxpermdi 34,34,34,3
	        blr

==================== Branch work198-bugs, patch #201 ====================

PR target/108958 -- use mtvsrdd to zero extend GPR DImode to VSX TImode

Previously GCC would zero externd a DImode GPR value to TImode by first zero
extending the DImode value into a GPR TImode value, and then do a MTVSRDD to
move this value to a VSX register.

This patch does the move directly, since if the middle argument to MTVSRDD is 0,
it does the zero extend.

If the DImode value is already in a vector register, it does a XXSPLTIB and
XXPERMDI to get the value into the bottom 64-bits of the register.

I have built GCC with the patches in this patch set applied on both little and
big endian PowerPC systems and there were no regressions.  Can I apply this
patch to GCC 15?
