This directory is used for GENERIC tag and parser_xxx development.

`make ccc` compiles the C program ccc.c, and dumps the GENERIC tags and creates a .gimple pseudo-code file.  The idea is to create simple C code as an exemplar of what you want the COBOL front end to generate.  Looking at the .gimple pseudo-code and the .tags file has been invaluable.

`make test` launches cobol1 in DEMO_TAKEOVER mode.  In this mode, the front-end parser is skipped and GENERIC tags are generated by explicit calls in genapi.c.  See the demonstration_administrator() routine.
