About to call the libc.so routine "getcwd" 
CWD is '/usr/local/bin'
 
About to call getcwd with RETURNING phrase
CWD is '/usr/local/bin'
RETURNED-CWD is '/usr/local/bin'
 
About to call "imitationcwd", which works like the libc.so routine "cwd" 
CWD is '/just/like/cwd'
 
About to call imitationcwd with RETURNING phrase
CWD is '/just/like/cwd'
RETURNED-CWD is '/just/like/cwd'
 
The COBOL "returner" routine will return "Whassup?" through RETURNING 
returner returned 'Whassup?                                                                                            '
 
About to call string_to_long with "123456"
string_to_long returned 123456
 
About to call long_to_string with 654321
long_to_string returned "654321"
 
 
COBOL will call C Routine_B, which will call COBOL routine_c
      I am COBOL routine_c
 
simple check of cobol-to-cobol BY CONTENT and BY REFERENCE
Before
I shouldn't change      
I should change         
 
after
I shouldn't change      
Good: I changed!        
pass 128-bit value to a C routine
The C routine string_to_long got the string "123456" from the caller, 
and is returning the 64-bit value 123456
The C code got the long integer 654321 from the caller, 
and is returning the string "654321"
   I am C routine_b(); I will call COBOL routine_c()
