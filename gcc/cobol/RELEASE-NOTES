This is the first packaged release of gcobol since the project was
announced in the fall of 2021. At that time, the compiler implemented
a textbook-version of COBOL, and had compiled 1000 lines of
pedagogical COBOL. Today, gcobol has compiled 10,000 lines of COBOL,
primarily from the NIST CCVS-85 test suite.

Features of gcobol now include:

It passes the Nucleus of the CCVS-85 test suite.

It supports free format, Reference Format, and Extended Reference Format.

It is documented in a man page, gcobol.1, included with this
distribution.

The user has COBOL access to the command line, and to environment variables.

The list of USAGE types for data items has been extended to include
most COBOL 2014 types.

Several command-line options now make the compiler more flexible and
easier to use.

CDF support includes COPY and conditional compilation.
