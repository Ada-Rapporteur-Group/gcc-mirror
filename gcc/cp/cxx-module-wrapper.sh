# FIXME this is a Quick and Dirty Hack.  It is not robust
# The API is not stable and can change at a moment's notice.
# It'd be nice to inform the driver that we're compiling
# an additional file, so it doesn't compile it itself
# It'd also be nice to do some kind of locking so parallel makes 'just work'
