Block Statements
****************

.. index:: Block statement

* The ``declare`` (optional), ``begin`` and ``end`` words
  are aligned, except when the block_statement is named.  There
  is a blank line before the ``begin`` keyword:

  .. index:: Alignment (in a block statement)

  .. code-block:: ada

          Some_Block : declare
             ...

          begin
             ...
          end Some_Block;
