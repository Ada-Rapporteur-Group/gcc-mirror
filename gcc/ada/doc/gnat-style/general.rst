Most of GNAT is written in Ada using a consistent style to ensure
readability of the code.  This document has been written to help
maintain this consistent style, while having a large group of developers
work on the compiler.

For the coding style in the C parts of the compiler and run time,
see the GNU Coding Guidelines.

This document is structured after the Ada Reference Manual.
Those familiar with that document should be able to quickly
lookup style rules for particular constructs.
