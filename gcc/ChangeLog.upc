2011-07-06  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Re-implement the pass that lowers trees generated by
	the UPC front-end into GENERIC.  Previously this was
	done within the gimplification framework, but this
	required that gimplification be run before inlining
	and various other passes, which did not fit in well
	with the current design of the middle-end passes.
	Now, the lowering is done by a newly defined language
	specific genericize hook.  With this change, we are
	are able to undo some extensions made to the gimplify
	logic, and thus can revert several files to trunk.

	* c-decl.c: Add a check for UPC deprecated names which
	  may appear as undefined function names.
	* libfuncs.h (LTI_upc_barrier, LTI_upc_notify, LTI_upc_wait,
	  LTI_upc_getaddr): Remove definitions of unused UPC
	  library function names.  These were defined back when
	  the libfunc interface was used to call these routines.
	* timevar.def (TV_TREE_UPC_GENERICIZE): New. Track time spent
	  in UPC lowering (genericize) pass.
	* langhooks.h (gimplify_expr): Revert to trunk's definition.
	  (instrument_func): Delete this hook.  Now handled in
	  upc_genericize().
	* tree-pass.h: Revert to trunk.
	* c-typeck.c (build_unary_op): Adjust reference to
	  upc_genericize() in a comment.
	* gimplify.c (create_tmp_var_raw): Delete logic that
	  was converting UPC shared types into unshared types
	  to be used for temporaries.  Now handled in  upc_genericize().
	  Replace with an assertion check.
	  (prepare_gimple_addressable): Revert to trunk's definition.
	  No longer needed as an externally called function.
	  (flag_instrument_functions_exclude_p): Re-define as
	  an externally called function.
	  (gimplify_function_tree): Delete code that implemented
	  call to UPC's language specific function instrumentation hook.
	* gimple.h (flag_instrument_functions_exclude_p): Define as extern.
	  (prepare_gimple_addressable): Delete extern definition;
	  revert to trunk's definition.
	* lnaghooks-def.h (lhd_gimplify_expr): Revert to trunk's definition.

	This keeps all the "C" variants together.
	* init.c (lang_defaults): Add an entry for UPC.

2011-06-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-parser.c (upc_localsizeof_type): Fix an ICE when compiling for
	a 32-bit target, the size expression overflowed, the result was
	error_mark_node, and an ICE was triggered on an attempt to evaluate
	C_TYPE_VARIABLE_SIZE() on the error node.
	(upc_blocksizeof_expr, upc_blocksizeof_type,
	upc_elemsizeof_expr, upc_elemsizeof_type, upc_localsizeof_expr):

2011-05-30  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* configure.ac: Make the default order of the virtual
	  address field in a UPC pointer-to-shared to be "first".
	  This reverts to the previous setting, and is a short term
	  measure to work around a bug found on the IA64,
	  where vaddr=last led to incorrect code generation.
	  Rename UPC_PTS_VADDR_FIRST to HAVE_UPC_PTS_VADDR_FIRST
	  in AC_DEFINE(), to agree with recent changes in files
	  that reference this define.
	  configure, config.in: Regenerate.

	  been moved to "upc/upc-pts.h".

	* configure, config.in: Regenerate.

	* Makefile.in (UPC_PTS_REP): Remove definition and revert
	  to trunk.  This substitution variable was used to
	  configure the representation-specific versions of
	  the tree rewrites that operate on UPC pointer-to-shared
	  types and objects.

	* c-parser.c (c_parser_upc_forall_statement): Remove
	  reference to UPC_FORALL_DEPTH_NAME, and call
	  newly defined upc_rts_forall_depth_var() instead.

	  moved to "upc/upc-rts-names.h", "defaults.h", and
	  "upc/upc-pts.h".

	* c-typeck.c: Fix bug: Cast of (shared <type> * shared) not
	  diagnosed as an error

	  The conversion from any type (shared or not) to
	  a shared type is likely either meaningless or an error.  This update
	  makes any conversion to a shared type, an error.

2010-10-18  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-typeck.c: Fix bug: passing int to shared pointer arg.
	  generates spurious warning

	  Add a #define procedure that does the same thing as
	  WARN_FOR_ASSIGNMENT but issues an error diagnostic instead.  Use
	  this procedure to diagnose passing an integer value to a
	  pointer-to-shared as an error.

2010-10-18  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-typeck.c: Fix bug: shared [] in prototype silently ignored when
	  matching routine declaration.

	  When checking for type compatibility, shared qualified types must
	  have the same block factor.  This check was missing from
	  comptypes_internal().  This update adds the check for blocking
	  factor equality.

	* c-decl.c: Fix a segfault/ICE that occurred when printing an error
	  message regarding a function parameter being declared with a shared
	  qualifier.

	  The parameter's 'name' value is not defined at this point, and
	  cannot be used in the error message.  This update removes the

2010-10-16  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* Makefile.in: Implement fixes for SGI/IRIX/MIPS port.

	  The gcc/Makefile.in rules for install-plugin had to be re-written to
	  break up a long list of header files that exceeded the command line
	  limitation imposed by Irix.

	  Access functions for TFmode types had to be implemented.
	  Apparently, this is the mode used for the SGI/MIPS port to represent
	  "long float".

2010-10-14  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix bug: Multiple equal blocking factors specified
	  via typedef chain should not be diagnosed as an error.

	  If the block size that is given by the typedef is equal to the block
	  size given explicitly in the variable declaration, then do not
	  complain.  The easiest way to make this check was to create a
	  temporary type that is a clone of the element type and then set its
	  block size using the given layout qualifier.  Then compare the block
	  size of the temporary (the declaration) to the block size specified
	  in the typedef.  This complexity is needed, because the '[*]' block
	  size needs to be calculated, and the '[]' needs to be mapped into a
	  zero block size.

2010-10-10  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix bug: ICE: two or more layout qualifiers
	  specified

	  The compiler properly detected the presence of two or more layout
	  qualifiers as an error, but then hit an assertion check, because the
	  code that followed the error expected to see a qualifier and not a
	  layout specifier.  The fix is simple: just return immediately after
	  detecting the error.

2010-10-10  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Improve error diagnostics for various cases of UPC
	  shared array type declarations.

	  Add the check for this error: "In the dynamic translation
	  environment, THREADS may not appear in declarations of shared arrays
	  with indefinite block size".  Also, fix up a few of the other
	  related error diagnostics.

2010-10-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-common.c: Fix bug: segfault on incomplete array definition.

	  This turned out to be a bit complicated.   The logic in
	  upc_lang_layout_decl had to be re-arranged to avoid trying to lookup
	  the THREADS identifier in the case where the blocking factor has
	  been set to indefinite ([]).  This can happen when indefinite array
	  declarations are processed for shared arrays.  At that time, the
	  file scope has been closed and THREADS is no longer in scope.  Some
	  more work is needed on upc_lang_layout_decl().  It has some
	  duplication, and notably duplicates the two branches of the if
	  having to do with TYPE_SIZE and TYPE_SIZE_UNIT, that appear in the
	  caller of this routine (layout_decl()).

	  The method of forcing a layout qualifier of [] in the indefinite
	  declaration handler is odd a well.  The code that just does the
	  setting of the block factor, needs to moved into its own routine
	  that doesn't depend upon a declspec for '[]' to be passed in, just
	  in order to set the blocking factor to some value (in this case, 0).
	  Also, the logic for how that shared type is constructed is strange.
	  First the type with 0 blocking factor is set.  Then the shared
	  qualifier is removed from the type, and then added back later.  The
	  intermediate type has a blocking factor set, but it has no shared
	  qualifier.  Fixing this will require some thought.  It is tempting
	  just to make indefinite shared arrays an error, rather than forcing
	  the dimension to be '1'.

	  This likely fixes a serious error in the previous update to
	  upc_lang_layout_decl(), where it didn't have the logic to set
	  TYPE_SIZE_UNIT() in the main part of the 'if' statement.  This means
	  the previous update would fail on many tests.

2010-10-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* varasm.c: Add an assertion check for the case that DECL_SIZE_UNIT
	  (decl) is null, which can happen if some layout error occurred
	  upstream.

2010-10-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix bug: file scope shared arrays mis-diagnosed as
	  "variable-sized" when compiled in dynamic threads.

	  This long-standing bug is easily fixed.  Just check
	  for the situation that the non-constant sized type is shared and
	  that it does not have a dimension that references a multiple of
	  threads.  If this criteria is met, then issue a meaningful
	  diagnostic.

2010-10-01  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* configure, configure.ac: Update manual page, and bug reporting
	  URL.

	  Update "man" page to reflect debugging switches.  Also, some general
	  clean up.  Change the bug reporting URL to point to gccupc.org.

2010-09-27  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-parser.c, config/upc-conf.h: Issue a descriptive message when
	  the UPC forall depth count variable is not found.

	  The __upc_forall_depth variable should be defined in gcc-upc-lib.h.
	  The compiler will generate code that references this variable in
	  order to implement nested upc_forall semantics.  If there is a
	  compiler build or install problem, this variable may not be found.
	  In this case, terminate with an internal_error().

2010-09-26  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-parser.c: Fix Bug 240: upc_forall with empty clauses
	  mis-diagnosed as syntax error.

	  Fix a failure exhibited by the Berkeley test case,
	  bug873a.upc, which has the code:
	       double d;
	       upc_forall (;;;d) {...} The compiler did not properly handle
	  the empty "condition" clause, and did not recover well when it was
	  determined that the use of a double value, "d" above, was neither a
	  pointer-to-shared nor an integer expression.  The update implements a
	  fix for both issues.

2010-09-23  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix Bug 29: Layout qualifier within a typedef is not
	  incorporated into the referencing type.

	  This was semi-fixed a few times before.  This update fixes a few
	  more places where the layout qualifier wasn't being propagated
	  through typedef's properly.  What made this a bit tricky is shown in
	  the example cited in the bug report:

	  typedef shared [5] int A_t; A_t A[5*THREADS];

	  In the typedef, the blocksize is being applied to a shared *scalar*,
	  and the code was applying the blocksize only to arrays.  This update
	  handles shared scalars correctly.

2010-09-22  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-parser.c, c-tree.h, stub-upc.c: Fix Bug 403: Nested
	  upc_forall() semantics are not implemented

	  The checkforall test in the Berkeley harness test suite indicated
	  that GCC/UPC was not properly implementing nested upc_forall
	  semantics.  Nested upc_forall statements (both statically or
	  dynamically nested) must implement their affinity clause as if it
	  were "continue"; thus all steps in the loop must execute without
	  regard for affinity.  To implement these semantics a global depth
	  counter, __upc_forall_depth, is maintained by the generated code
	  that implements upc_forall.

	* c-decl.c: c-decl.c: zero out the layout specifier, after
	  processing an array type.

	  Fix the previous fix, that moved the setting of the type's layout
	  qualifier to the outside of the array type processing loop.  What is
	  missing from the fix is that the layout_qualifier variable needs to
	  be cleared after setting the type's blocksize.

2010-09-19  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* config/upc-conf.h: Fix Bug 375: error message is off-by-one when
	  given blocksize is greater than UPC_MAX_BLOCKSIZE.

	  The value we were using for UPC_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE was one bigger than
	  the actual maximum block size.  Therefore, the message was correct,
	  but the underlying value that was being checked was wrong.  Change
	  the values so that they agree with the actual implementation-defined
	  limit.

2010-09-11  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix Bug 402: ICE: '[*]' layout factor on
	  multi-dimensional shared array with dynamic threads.

	  This declaration caused an internal compiler error when compiled
	  with dynamic threads:
	      shared [*] int A[THREADS][16]; The bug was discovered when
	  compiling the RTED_UPC test suite.

	  The fix is to process layout qualifiers after the entire array type
	  has been built.  Otherwise, we try to calculate the blocksize on a
	  shared array type that has not had its "size depends upon the value
	  of THREADS" flag set.

	  Also, added a test case.
