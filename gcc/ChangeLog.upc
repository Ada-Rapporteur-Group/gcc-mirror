2013-04-02  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Revert revision 178346 (2011-08-30)
	which changed the prototype of check_qualified_type and related
	functions so that their parameters were just 'tree' and not
	'const_tree'.  This seemed necessary at the time because of a
	change to TYPE_BLOCK_FACTOR(), which in turn called function
	that hashed the type node pointer.  The hash functions did
	not accept "const void *" pointers.  Implement a work around
	that removes this restriction.
	* c/c-typeck.c: Revert.
	* tree.c: Revert.
	* tree.h: Revert.  Change prototype of upc_block_factor_lookup()
	to accept a 'const_tree' pointer to a type node.

2011-07-06  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Re-implement the pass that lowers trees generated by
	the UPC front-end into GENERIC.  Previously this was
	done within the gimplification framework, but this
	required that gimplification be run before inlining
	and various other passes, which did not fit in well
	with the current design of the middle-end passes.
	Now, the lowering is done by a newly defined language
	specific genericize hook.  With this change, we are
	are able to undo some extensions made to the gimplify
	logic, and thus can revert several files to trunk.
	* c-decl.c: Add a check for UPC deprecated names which
	  may appear as undefined function names.
	* libfuncs.h (LTI_upc_barrier, LTI_upc_notify, LTI_upc_wait,
	  LTI_upc_getaddr): Remove definitions of unused UPC
	  library function names.  These were defined back when
	  the libfunc interface was used to call these routines.
	* timevar.def (TV_TREE_UPC_GENERICIZE): New. Track time spent
	  in UPC lowering (genericize) pass.
	* langhooks.h (gimplify_expr): Revert to trunk's definition.

	  upc_genericize().
	* tree-pass.h: Revert to trunk.
	* c-typeck.c (build_unary_op): Adjust reference to
	  upc_genericize() in a comment.
	* gimplify.c (create_tmp_var_raw): Delete logic that
	  was converting UPC shared types into unshared types
	  to be used for temporaries.  Now handled in  upc_genericize().
	  Replace with an assertion check.
	  (prepare_gimple_addressable): Revert to trunk's definition.
	  No longer needed as an externally called function.
	  (flag_instrument_functions_exclude_p): Re-define as
	  an externally called function.
	  (gimplify_function_tree): Delete code that implemented
	  call to UPC's language specific function instrumentation hook.
	* gimple.h (flag_instrument_functions_exclude_p): Define as extern.
	  (prepare_gimple_addressable): Delete extern definition;

	This keeps all the "C" variants together.
	* init.c (lang_defaults): Add an entry for UPC.

2011-06-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-parser.c (upc_localsizeof_type): Fix an ICE when compiling for
	a 32-bit target, the size expression overflowed, the result was
	error_mark_node, and an ICE was triggered on an attempt to evaluate
	C_TYPE_VARIABLE_SIZE() on the error node.
	(upc_blocksizeof_expr, upc_blocksizeof_type,
	upc_elemsizeof_expr, upc_elemsizeof_type, upc_localsizeof_expr):

	* configure.ac: Make the default order of the virtual
	  address field in a UPC pointer-to-shared to be "first".
	  This reverts to the previous setting, and is a short term
	  measure to work around a bug found on the IA64,
	  where vaddr=last led to incorrect code generation.
	  Rename UPC_PTS_VADDR_FIRST to HAVE_UPC_PTS_VADDR_FIRST
	  in AC_DEFINE(), to agree with recent changes in files
	  that reference this define.
	  configure, config.in: Regenerate.

2011-05-26  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	  been moved to "upc/upc-pts.h".
	* configure, config.in: Regenerate.
	* Makefile.in (UPC_PTS_REP): Remove definition and revert

	  configure the representation-specific versions of
	  the tree rewrites that operate on UPC pointer-to-shared
	  types and objects.
	* c-parser.c (c_parser_upc_forall_statement): Remove
	  reference to UPC_FORALL_DEPTH_NAME, and call

	  configure: Regenerate (also picks up changes from previous
	  merge with trunk).

2011-03-20  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Move UPC start files, end files, and linker specs.
	into libupc.  This reduces the impact on common GCC
	configuration files, and ensures that these UPC-specific
	components are only built when the UPC language dialect is selected.
	* c-family/c.opt: Add -fupc-link switch, used to select UPC-specific
	  linker specs. Fix typo in -fupc-debug message.
	* config/upc-conf.h, config/darwin.h: Move defines for
	  UPC-related section begins/ends into libupc/config/default/
	  upc-crt-config.h.
	* config/darwin.h(LINK_COMMAND_SPEC_A): Add call outs to
	  UPC-related linker compiler specifications,
	  accessed via %:include().
	* configure.ac, configure: Remove logic related to building
	  	upc-crtbegin/end. Remove config. tests for numa and cpu
	  affinity (previously used by the 'upc' driver); these
	  settings are now propagated by target-specific compiler
	  specs. built by libupc.  Regenerate autoconf.
	* gcc.c (LINK_COMMAND_SPEC): Add call outs to UPC-related
	  linker compiler specifications, accessed via %:include().
	  Define 'upc_crtbegin_spec', 'upc_crtend_spec', and
	  'link_upc_spec'.
	* Makefile.in: Remove definition of UPC_CRTSTUFF_CFLAGS.
	* config/linux.h, config/i386/darwin.h, config/i386/linux64.h,

	  config/ia64/linux.h, config/mips/t-iris,
	  config/mips/iris6.h: Revert to trunk version 167307.
	libgcc/
	* configure, configure.ac, config.host, Makefile.in:
	  Revert to trunk version 167307.

2011-02-23  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

2011-02-22  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c (undeclared_variable): call upc_diagnose_deprecated_stmt
	to check for the usage of certain deprecated UPC keywords.

	* c-tree.h (undeclared_variable): Define prototype.

2011-02-12  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-typeck.c: (build_c_cast, convert_for_assignment)
	  Diagnose an attempt to convert from an integer to
	  a pointer-to-shared as an error.  Also, fix various
	  error messages so that they use the preferred term
	  pointer-to-shared instead of "shared pointer".

2011-02-07  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-typeck.c: (convert_for_assignment)
	  Fix typo. in error message.

2011-01-23  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-typeck.c: (c_build_qualified_type)
	  derive UPC block size by calling upc_get_block_size(),
	  to ensure that the element type of an array of an array
	  is derived correctly.

2010-12-29  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Merge trunk version 168314 into gupc branch.

2010-12-15  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Merge trunk version 167307 into gupc branch.

2010-10-19  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-typeck.c: Fix typo in previous fix
	  which led to a mis-compare for equal block sizes.

2010-10-18  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-typeck.c: Fix bug: Cast of (shared <type> * shared) not
	  diagnosed as an error
	  The conversion from any type (shared or not) to
	  a shared type is likely either meaningless or an error.  This update
	  makes any conversion to a shared type, an error.

2010-10-18  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-typeck.c: Fix bug: passing int to shared pointer arg.
	  generates spurious warning
	  Add a #define procedure that does the same thing as
	  WARN_FOR_ASSIGNMENT but issues an error diagnostic instead.  Use
	  this procedure to diagnose passing an integer value to a
	  pointer-to-shared as an error.

2010-10-18  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-typeck.c: Fix bug: shared [] in prototype silently ignored when
	  matching routine declaration.
	  When checking for type compatibility, shared qualified types must
	  have the same block factor.  This check was missing from
	  comptypes_internal().  This update adds the check for blocking
	  factor equality.

2010-10-17  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* dwarf2out.c: Fix GCC Bug 45870 - note: non-delegitimized UNSPEC 5
	  found (-O1 -g)

	  produces ice with -O3 and -m32.
	  See: http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45869

2010-10-17  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-common.c: Diagnose the application of the various "*sizeof"
	  operations on generic pointer-to-shared as a compilation error.

2010-10-17  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix a segfault/ICE that occurred when printing an error
	  message regarding a function parameter being declared with a shared
	  qualifier.
	  The parameter's 'name' value is not defined at this point, and
	  cannot be used in the error message.  This update removes the
	  reference to 'name', and eliminates the segfault.

2010-10-16  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* Makefile.in: Implement fixes for SGI/IRIX/MIPS port.
	  The gcc/Makefile.in rules for install-plugin had to be re-written to
	  break up a long list of header files that exceeded the command line
	  limitation imposed by Irix.
	  Access functions for TFmode types had to be implemented.
	  Apparently, this is the mode used for the SGI/MIPS port to represent
	  "long float".

2010-10-14  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix bug: Multiple equal blocking factors specified
	  via typedef chain should not be diagnosed as an error.
	  If the block size that is given by the typedef is equal to the block
	  size given explicitly in the variable declaration, then do not
	  complain.  The easiest way to make this check was to create a
	  temporary type that is a clone of the element type and then set its
	  block size using the given layout qualifier.  Then compare the block
	  size of the temporary (the declaration) to the block size specified
	  in the typedef.  This complexity is needed, because the '[*]' block
	  size needs to be calculated, and the '[]' needs to be mapped into a
	  zero block size.

2010-10-10  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix bug: ICE: two or more layout qualifiers
	  specified
	  The compiler properly detected the presence of two or more layout
	  qualifiers as an error, but then hit an assertion check, because the
	  code that followed the error expected to see a qualifier and not a
	  layout specifier.  The fix is simple: just return immediately after
	  detecting the error.

2010-10-10  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Improve error diagnostics for various cases of UPC
	  shared array type declarations.
	  Add the check for this error: "In the dynamic translation
	  environment, THREADS may not appear in declarations of shared arrays
	  with indefinite block size".  Also, fix up a few of the other
	  related error diagnostics.

2010-10-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-common.c: Fix bug: segfault on incomplete array definition.
	  This turned out to be a bit complicated.   The logic in
	  upc_lang_layout_decl had to be re-arranged to avoid trying to lookup
	  the THREADS identifier in the case where the blocking factor has
	  been set to indefinite ([]).  This can happen when indefinite array
	  declarations are processed for shared arrays.  At that time, the
	  file scope has been closed and THREADS is no longer in scope.  Some
	  more work is needed on upc_lang_layout_decl().  It has some
	  duplication, and notably duplicates the two branches of the if
	  having to do with TYPE_SIZE and TYPE_SIZE_UNIT, that appear in the
	  caller of this routine (layout_decl()).
	  The method of forcing a layout qualifier of [] in the indefinite
	  declaration handler is odd a well.  The code that just does the
	  setting of the block factor, needs to moved into its own routine
	  that doesn't depend upon a declspec for '[]' to be passed in, just
	  in order to set the blocking factor to some value (in this case, 0).
	  Also, the logic for how that shared type is constructed is strange.
	  First the type with 0 blocking factor is set.  Then the shared
	  qualifier is removed from the type, and then added back later.  The
	  intermediate type has a blocking factor set, but it has no shared
	  qualifier.  Fixing this will require some thought.  It is tempting
	  just to make indefinite shared arrays an error, rather than forcing
	  the dimension to be '1'.
	  This likely fixes a serious error in the previous update to
	  upc_lang_layout_decl(), where it didn't have the logic to set
	  TYPE_SIZE_UNIT() in the main part of the 'if' statement.  This means
	  the previous update would fail on many tests.

2010-10-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* varasm.c: Add an assertion check for the case that DECL_SIZE_UNIT
	  (decl) is null, which can happen if some layout error occurred
	  upstream.

2010-10-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix bug: file scope shared arrays mis-diagnosed as
	  "variable-sized" when compiled in dynamic threads.
	  This long-standing bug is easily fixed.  Just check
	  for the situation that the non-constant sized type is shared and
	  that it does not have a dimension that references a multiple of
	  threads.  If this criteria is met, then issue a meaningful
	  diagnostic.

2010-10-01  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* configure, configure.ac: Update manual page, and bug reporting
	  URL.  Update "man" page to reflect debugging switches.
	  Also, some general clean up.  Change the bug reporting
	  URL to point to gccupc.org.

2010-09-27  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-parser.c, config/upc-conf.h: Issue a descriptive message when
	  the UPC forall depth count variable is not found.
	  The __upc_forall_depth variable should be defined in gcc-upc-lib.h.
	  The compiler will generate code that references this variable in
	  order to implement nested upc_forall semantics.  If there is a
	  compiler build or install problem, this variable may not be found.
	  In this case, terminate with an internal_error().

2010-09-26  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-parser.c: Fix Bug 240: upc_forall with empty clauses
	  mis-diagnosed as syntax error.
	  Fix a failure exhibited by the Berkeley test case,
	  bug873a.upc, which has the code:
	       double d;
	       upc_forall (;;;d) {...} The compiler did not properly handle
	  the empty "condition" clause, and did not recover well when it was
	  determined that the use of a double value, "d" above, was neither a
	  pointer-to-shared nor an integer expression.  The update implements a
	  fix for both issues.
	  See also: gcc/c-parser.c gcc/upc/upc-act.c

2010-09-23  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix Bug 29: Layout qualifier within a typedef is not
	  incorporated into the referencing type.
	  This was semi-fixed a few times before.  This update fixes a few
	  more places where the layout qualifier wasn't being propagated
	  through typedef's properly.  What made this a bit tricky is shown in
	  the example cited in the bug report:
	  typedef shared [5] int A_t; A_t A[5*THREADS];
	  In the typedef, the blocksize is being applied to a shared *scalar*,
	  and the code was applying the blocksize only to arrays.  This update
	  handles shared scalars correctly.

2010-09-22  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-parser.c, c-tree.h, stub-upc.c: Fix Bug 403: Nested
	  upc_forall() semantics are not implemented
	  The checkforall test in the Berkeley harness test suite indicated
	  that GCC/UPC was not properly implementing nested upc_forall
	  semantics.  Nested upc_forall statements (both statically or
	  dynamically nested) must implement their affinity clause as if it
	  were "continue"; thus all steps in the loop must execute without
	  regard for affinity.  To implement these semantics a global depth
	  counter, __upc_forall_depth, is maintained by the generated code
	  that implements upc_forall.

2010-09-19  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: c-decl.c: zero out the layout specifier, after
	  processing an array type.
	  Fix the previous fix, that moved the setting of the type's layout
	  qualifier to the outside of the array type processing loop.  What is
	  missing from the fix is that the layout_qualifier variable needs to
	  be cleared after setting the type's blocksize.

2010-09-19  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* config/upc-conf.h: Fix Bug 375: error message is off-by-one when
	  given blocksize is greater than UPC_MAX_BLOCKSIZE.
	  The value we were using for UPC_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE was one bigger than
	  the actual maximum block size.  Therefore, the message was correct,
	  but the underlying value that was being checked was wrong.  Change
	  the values so that they agree with the actual implementation-defined
	  limit.

2010-09-11  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix Bug 402: ICE: '[*]' layout factor on
	  multi-dimensional shared array with dynamic threads.
	  This declaration caused an internal compiler error when compiled
	  with dynamic threads:
	      shared [*] int A[THREADS][16]; The bug was discovered when
	  compiling the RTED_UPC test suite.
	  The fix is to process layout qualifiers after the entire array type
	  has been built.  Otherwise, we try to calculate the blocksize on a
	  shared array type that has not had its "size depends upon the value
	  of THREADS" flag set.
	  Also, added a test case.
	  See also: libupc/testsuite/libupc.upc/intrepid/test18.upc

2010-07-11  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Fix a bug where a statement in c_build_qualified_type()

	the list of language kinds accepted by the
	C preprocessor.  This is not necessary because
	UPC is a derivative of C99, and does not need
	a different language kind.
	* c-family/c-opts.c (c_common_handle_option):
	Call set_std_c99() when processing the
	"--lang upc" switch, instead of setting the

	Re-implement the pass that lowers trees generated by

	done within the gimplification framework, but this
	required that gimplification be run before inlining
	and various other passes, which did not fit in well
	with the current design of the middle-end passes.
	Now, the lowering is done by a newly defined language
	specific genericize hook.  With this change, we are
	are able to undo some extensions made to the gimplify
	logic, and thus can revert several files to trunk.
	* c-decl.c: Add a check for UPC deprecated names which

	  No longer needed as an externally called function.
	  (flag_instrument_functions_exclude_p): Re-define as

2011-05-30  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* configure.ac: Make the default order of the virtual
	  address field in a UPC pointer-to-shared to be "first".

2011-03-20  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Move UPC start files, end files, and linker specs.
	into libupc.  This reduces the impact on common GCC
	configuration files, and ensures that these UPC-specific
	components are only built when the UPC language dialect is selected.
	* upc/config-lang.in: Remove setting of 'upc_extra_parts', which
	  was used to specify which upc-crtbegin and upc-crtend files
	  need to built.  Remove extraneous (commented out)
	  settings of 'cfiles'.  The listed configuration files
	  have been reverted to trunk, and weren't referenced
	  via cfiles in any event.
	* upc/upc-cmd.c: Remove test for HAVE_UPC_LINK_SCRIPT.
	  Simply test for the presence of the UPC link script
	  in the current directory or the libupc directory.
	  Add -B<path-to-libupc> to the switches passed to 'gcc';
	  this is needed in order to find the upc-crtbegin
	  and upc-crtend object files now built in libupc.
	  Remove test for and inclusion of UPC_LINKER_SWITCHES.
	  if extra switches are needed for a particular target
	  (like SGI/Irix), they will be defined by the custom
	  linker spec. built in libupc.  Remove test for
	  HAVE_UPC_NUMA_SUPPORT; if '-lnuma' is needed, it
	  will be added to the custom linker specs. built
	  in libupc.
	* upc/upc-crtstuff.c: Move to libupc.

	  pointer-to-shared instead of "shared pointer".

2011-02-08  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc/upc-pts-struct.c: Fix bug: (pts + int) fails when int is negative
	  for struct-pts representation
	  Analysis indicated that for something like (+ ptr -80) this was
	  being represented as (+ ptr (- 80)) and further, when the
	  calculations were propagated into the individual operations on the
	  components of the 'struct' pointer, it would end up with something
	  like (+ ptr.vaddr (- 80)), and the type of (- 80) would end up as
	  "long unsigned int" because of the addition to the pointer.  This
	  caused the calculations involving the signed 'int' operand to be
	  performed incorrectly.  This fix insures that the 'int' operand is
	  signed.

2010-12-15  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Merge trunk version 167307 into gupc branch.
	* upc/_act.h: (upc_handle_option) add location and struct
	cl_option_handlers * parameters.
	(upc_finish_file) Remove.
	(upc_write_global_declarations) New, replaces upc_finish_file.
	* lang-spec.h: Disable multi-file compilation for .upc files.
	This fixes an issue where file-scoped static variables were
	diagnosed as multiply-defined.  Both "C" and "ObjC" also disable
	multi-file compilation.
	* upc/upc-gimplify.c: (upc_expand_put) Check for INDIRECT_REF_P()
	explicitly when deciding whether a UPC shared object is addressable.
	is_gimple_addressable() used to do this, but now checks for MEM_REF
	which does not apply to UPC shared objects.
	(upc_gimplify_lval, upc_gimplify_expr) Delete references to
	ALIGN_INDIRECT_REF and MISALIGNED_INDIRECT_REF.
	These are no longer defined.
	(upc_genericize) Add call to bitmap_obstack_initialize()
	and bitmap_obstack_release() around call to gimplify_function_tree().
	* upc/upc-lang.c: Add #include of "opts.h" and "options.h".
	(flag_upc_debug, flag_upc_inline_lib, flag_upc_instrument,

	* upc/upc-pts-struct.c: (upc_pts_init_type) Move test that
	UPC_PTS_THREAD_SIZE is a multiple of a byte into an "if" statement
	rather than an #ifdef; this macro now depends upon a
	target size macro which must be evaluated at runtime.
	* upc/Make-lang.in: (cc1-dummy) Remove make target.
	(cc1upc-checksum.c) Generate directly from object files.
	* upc/upc-cmd.c: (SWITCH_TAKES_ARG, WORD_SWITCH_TAKES_ARG) Delete

	* c-typeck.c: Fix bug: Cast of (shared <type> * shared) not
	  diagnosed as an error
	  The conversion from any type (shared or not) to
	  a shared type is likely either meaningless or an error.  This update
	  makes any conversion to a shared type, an error.

2010-10-18  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-typeck.c: Fix bug: passing int to shared pointer arg.
	  generates spurious warning
	  Add a #define procedure that does the same thing as
	  WARN_FOR_ASSIGNMENT but issues an error diagnostic instead.  Use
	  this procedure to diagnose passing an integer value to a
	  pointer-to-shared as an error.

2010-10-18  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-typeck.c: Fix bug: shared [] in prototype silently ignored when
	  matching routine declaration.
	  When checking for type compatibility, shared qualified types must
	  have the same block factor.  This check was missing from
	  comptypes_internal().  This update adds the check for blocking

2010-10-17  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix a segfault/ICE that occurred when printing an error
	  message regarding a function parameter being declared with a shared
	  qualifier.
	  The parameter's 'name' value is not defined at this point, and
	  cannot be used in the error message.  This update removes the

2010-10-17  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc/upc-act.c: Issue a compilation error on attempts to perform
	  arithmetic on generic pointer-to-shared values.
	  (The rest of this update is a small code clean up.)

2010-10-17  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc/upc-lang.c: For UPC only, issue errors for arithmetic and related
	  operations on void types.
	  This update simulates the effect of -Werror=pointer-arith, thus
	  causing arithmetic on void types, sizeof(void) and so on to be
	  considered compilation errors.  This meets the expectations of some
	  harness tests and the RTED/CTED test suites.  GCC is more
	  permissive, but since this is for UPC only, we can fairly safely
	  define this new policy.

2010-10-16  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* Makefile.in: Implement fixes for SGI/IRIX/MIPS port.
	  The gcc/Makefile.in rules for install-plugin had to be re-written to
	  break up a long list of header files that exceeded the command line
	  limitation imposed by Irix.
	  Access functions for TFmode types had to be implemented.
	  Apparently, this is the mode used for the SGI/MIPS port to represent
	  "long float".

2010-10-16  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc/upc-act.c: Fix bug: Static initialization of shared
	  arrays is unsupported -- issue an error message.
	  Currently, static initialization of a shared array is not
	  implemented correctly.
	  We do not plan to fix this for a while, therefore the compiler will
	  issue an error message indicating that this is an unsupported
	  operation.

2010-10-14  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix bug: Multiple equal blocking factors specified
	  via typedef chain should not be diagnosed as an error.
	  If the block size that is given by the typedef is equal to the block
	  size given explicitly in the variable declaration, then do not
	  complain.  The easiest way to make this check was to create a
	  temporary type that is a clone of the element type and then set its
	  block size using the given layout qualifier.  Then compare the block
	  size of the temporary (the declaration) to the block size specified
	  in the typedef.  This complexity is needed, because the '[*]' block
	  size needs to be calculated, and the '[]' needs to be mapped into a
	  zero block size.

2010-10-13  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc/upc-act.c: Fix bug: negative layout qualifiers not diagnosed
	  as an error.
	  The CTED_UPC test c_A_1_3_b.upc, specified a negative blocksize, but
	  it was not diagnosed as an error.  With this fix, negative block
	  sizes will generate a translation error.

2010-10-10  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix bug: ICE: two or more layout qualifiers
	  specified
	  The compiler properly detected the presence of two or more layout
	  qualifiers as an error, but then hit an assertion check, because the
	  code that followed the error expected to see a qualifier and not a
	  layout specifier.  The fix is simple: just return immediately after
	  detecting the error.

2010-10-10  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Improve error diagnostics for various cases of UPC
	  shared array type declarations.
	  Add the check for this error: "In the dynamic translation
	  environment, THREADS may not appear in declarations of shared arrays
	  with indefinite block size".  Also, fix up a few of the other
	  related error diagnostics.

2010-10-10  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* upc/upc-act.c: Fix bug: ICE: Attempt to take the difference of
	  shared and non-shared pointers
	  The compiler detected the error, and then tried to return
	  error_mark_node.  This apparently is not acceptable, as there is an
	  explicit assertion check to prevent this from happening in
	  build_binary_op.  Return the more user-friendly size_one_node
	  instead.

2010-10-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-common.c: Fix bug: segfault on incomplete array definition.
	  This turned out to be a bit complicated.   The logic in
	  upc_lang_layout_decl had to be re-arranged to avoid trying to lookup
	  the THREADS identifier in the case where the blocking factor has
	  been set to indefinite ([]).  This can happen when indefinite array
	  declarations are processed for shared arrays.  At that time, the
	  file scope has been closed and THREADS is no longer in scope.  Some
	  more work is needed on upc_lang_layout_decl().  It has some
	  duplication, and notably duplicates the two branches of the if
	  having to do with TYPE_SIZE and TYPE_SIZE_UNIT, that appear in the
	  caller of this routine (layout_decl()).
	  The method of forcing a layout qualifier of [] in the indefinite
	  declaration handler is odd a well.  The code that just does the
	  setting of the block factor, needs to moved into its own routine
	  that doesn't depend upon a declspec for '[]' to be passed in, just
	  in order to set the blocking factor to some value (in this case, 0).
	  Also, the logic for how that shared type is constructed is strange.
	  First the type with 0 blocking factor is set.  Then the shared
	  qualifier is removed from the type, and then added back later.  The
	  intermediate type has a blocking factor set, but it has no shared
	  qualifier.  Fixing this will require some thought.  It is tempting
	  just to make indefinite shared arrays an error, rather than forcing
	  the dimension to be '1'.
	  This likely fixes a serious error in the previous update to
	  upc_lang_layout_decl(), where it didn't have the logic to set
	  TYPE_SIZE_UNIT() in the main part of the 'if' statement.  This means
	  the previous update would fail on many tests.

2010-10-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* varasm.c: Add an assertion check for the case that DECL_SIZE_UNIT
	  (decl) is null, which can happen if some layout error occurred
	  upstream.

2010-10-09  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix bug: file scope shared arrays mis-diagnosed as
	  "variable-sized" when compiled in dynamic threads.
	  This long-standing bug is easily fixed.  Just check
	  for the situation that the non-constant sized type is shared and
	  that it does not have a dimension that references a multiple of
	  threads.  If this criteria is met, then issue a meaningful
	  diagnostic.

	* c-decl.c: Fix Bug 29: Layout qualifier within a typedef is not
	  incorporated into the referencing type.
	  This was semi-fixed a few times before.  This update fixes a few
	  more places where the layout qualifier wasn't being propagated
	  through typedef's properly.  What made this a bit tricky is shown in
	  the example cited in the bug report:
	  typedef shared [5] int A_t; A_t A[5*THREADS];
	  In the typedef, the blocksize is being applied to a shared *scalar*,
	  and the code was applying the blocksize only to arrays.  This update
	  handles shared scalars correctly.

	* c-parser.c, c-tree.h, stub-upc.c: Fix Bug 403: Nested
	  upc_forall() semantics are not implemented
	  The checkforall test in the Berkeley harness test suite indicated
	  that GCC/UPC was not properly implementing nested upc_forall
	  semantics.  Nested upc_forall statements (both statically or
	  dynamically nested) must implement their affinity clause as if it
	  were "continue"; thus all steps in the loop must execute without
	  regard for affinity.  To implement these semantics a global depth
	  counter, __upc_forall_depth, is maintained by the generated code
	  that implements upc_forall.

	  semantics.  Nested upc_forall statements (both statically or
	  dynamically nested) must implement their affinity clause as if it
	  were "continue"; thus all steps in the loop must execute without
	  regard for affinity.  To implement these semantics a global depth
	  counter, __upc_forall_depth, is maintained by the generated code
	  that implements upc_forall.

	* c-decl.c: c-decl.c: zero out the layout specifier, after
	  processing an array type.
	  Fix the previous fix, that moved the setting of the type's layout
	  qualifier to the outside of the array type processing loop.  What is
	  missing from the fix is that the layout_qualifier variable needs to
	  be cleared after setting the type's blocksize.

	* config/upc-conf.h: Fix Bug 375: error message is off-by-one when
	  given blocksize is greater than UPC_MAX_BLOCKSIZE.
	  The value we were using for UPC_MAX_BLOCK_SIZE was one bigger than
	  the actual maximum block size.  Therefore, the message was correct,
	  but the underlying value that was being checked was wrong.  Change
	  the values so that they agree with the actual implementation-defined
	  limit.

	* upc/upc-act.c, upc/upc-pts-packed.c, upc/upc-pts-struct.c:
	  Implement -fupc-debug switch.

2010-09-11  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	* c-decl.c: Fix Bug 402: ICE: '[*]' layout factor on
	  multi-dimensional shared array with dynamic threads.
	  This declaration caused an internal compiler error when compiled
	  with dynamic threads:
	      shared [*] int A[THREADS][16]; The bug was discovered when
	  compiling the RTED_UPC test suite.
	  The fix is to process layout qualifiers after the entire array type
	  has been built.  Otherwise, we try to calculate the blocksize on a
	  shared array type that has not had its "size depends upon the value
	  of THREADS" flag set.
	  Also, added a test case.

2010-07-11  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Fix a bug where a statement in c_build_qualified_type()
	in the trunk had been inadvertently deleted.
	This bug showed up in the IA64 port, because jmpbuf's
	on that architecture must be 16 byte aligned, and they were not.
	c-typeck.c (c_build_qualified_type): Revive the deleted line.

2010-07-08  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Make changes so that other language compilers
	will build and bootstrap.
	* c-family/c-common.c (compiling_upc, flag_upc,
	flag_upc_instrument, flag_upc_instrument_functions,
	use_upc_dwarf2_extensions): Move to stub-upc.c and
	upc-lang.c.
	* c-family/c-common.h (use_upc_dwarf2_extensions,
	compiling_upc): Add extern definitions - needed
	to compile/build other language front ends.
	* c-family/c.opt: Fix the spelling of ObjC.
	It had been incorrectly spelled as Objc.
	* c-family/c.opt: Add UPC for the various switches
	that are valid for both C and ObjC.
	* c-family/c-opts.c: Add CL_UPC to the list of
	supported options switches when compiling assembly
	language.
	* lto/lto-lang.c (use_upc_dwarf2_extensions,
	flag_upc_instrument, flag_upc_instrument_functions):
	Remove these definitions.  They have been moved
	to c-family/stub-upc.c.
	* upc/ChangeLog: Move relevant entries
	to ChangeLog.upc.
	* c-family/stub-upc.c (compiling_upc, flag_upc,
	flag_upc_instrument, flag_upc_instrument_functions,
	use_upc_dwarf2_extensions): Moved from c-common.c
	* upc/upc-lang.c (compiling_upc, flag_upc,
	flag_upc_instrument, flag_upc_instrument_functions,
	use_upc_dwarf2_extensions): Moved from c-common.c
	* objc/objc-act.c (objc_gimplify_expr): Add additional
	parameters to c_gimplify_expr() call, that are used
	by upc's tree rewrites.
	* cp/cp-gimplify.c (cp_gimplify_expr): Likewise.
	* gcc/cp/lex.c (init_reswords): If not compiling
	UPC, then mask off the UPC keywords.
	* cp/Make-lang.in (C_STUB_OBJS): Use this
	make macro to link with c-family/stub-objc.o
	and c-family/stub-upc.o.
	* fortran/Make-lang.in (C_STUB_OBJS): Likewise.
	* java/Make-lang.in (C_STUB_OBJS): Likewise.
	* objc/Make-lang.in: Link with c-family/stub-upc.o
	to avoid undefined references.
	c-parser.c: Fix line indentation.
	* libcpp/include/cpplib.h: Remove CL_UPC from
	the list of language kinds accepted by the
	C preprocessor.  This is not necessary because
	UPC is a derivative of C99, and does not need
	a different language kind.
	* c-family/c-opts.c (c_common_handle_option):
	Call set_std_c99() when processing the
	"--lang upc" switch, instead of setting the
	language kind to CL_UPC.
	* libupc/testsuite/libupc.upc/intrepid/ChangeLog: New.

2010-07-03  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Merge trunk version 161517 into gupc branch.
	* gcc/stub-upc.c: Move to gcc/c-family/.
	* libupc/testsuite/libupc.upc/intrepid/test19.upc:
	Add 'unused' attributes to avoid "set, but
	not referenced" warnings.
	* libupc/testsuite/libupc.upc/intrepid/test18.upc:
	Likewise.

2010-07-03  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Merge trunk version 161517 into gupc branch.

	  effect pass through call to c_common_handle_option.
	* upc/upc-act.h: (upc_handle_option) Likewise.
	* upc/upc-act.c: (map_unshared_var) used typed ggc allocation.
	* upc/upc-act.c: (upc_build_init_func) add call to
	  to mark_decl_referenced(), to ensure that UPC shared
	  variable initializer function is not removed from
	  the call tree graph.

2010-03-01  Gary Funck  <gary@intrepid.com>

	Create gupc branch from trunk version 157149.
