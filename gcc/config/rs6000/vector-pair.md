;; This file adds support for doing vector operations on pairs of vector
;; registers.  Most of the instructions use vector pair instructions to load
;; and possibly store registers, but splitting the operation after register
;; allocation to do 2 separate operations.  The second scheduler pass can
;; interleave other instructions between these pairs of instructions if
;; possible.
