	assembler name.

	* c-cilk.c (compute_loop_var): Added a check for integral type of loop 
	var and set the count type accordingly.  Removed all occurances of 
	checking the pointer type.
	(build_cilk_for_body): Likewise.
	(declare_cilk_for_vars): Changed the generic name form new iteration 
	var. and inherited it from the existing one.
	(extract_for_fields): Added a new variable loopover that is used to see
	if the _Cilk_for is utilizing the overflow rollover check.

	* c-cilk.c (extract_for_fields): Set invalid to false as the 
	initialization value.  Replaced unreachable with a comparison error.  
	Also, added a check if the end-value is less than start value for
	_Cilk_for.
	(compute_loop_var): Set the convert value to unsigned long for pointer
	type count.
	(build_cilk_for_body): Added a check for pointer type, and if so, do
	a type convert (this is done twice).

	* c-cilk.c (install_body_with_frame_cleanup): Moved enter_frame call
	from here to the gimplify_call_expr (right before inserting detach).
	(recognize_spawn): Set the Cilk_spawn's detach point to the initial
	node of the target-expr.
	(cilk_valid_spawn): Fixed a bug of checking the TARGET_EXPR's initial
	node instead of the node itself.
	(gimplify_cilk_spawn): Set the expression's location correctly.

	* c-cilk.c (recognize_spawn): Added a check for not TARGET_EXPR.
	(cilk_valid_spawn): Added a check if TARGET_EXPR_INITIAL is not an
	aggregate init. expr.

	pragma cilk gransize, pragma simd assert, noasssert, vectorlength,
	private, linear and reduction.
