	* c-typeck.c (handle_omp_array_sections_1): Allow non-zero low-bound
	on OMP_CLAUSE_REDUCTION array sections.
	(handle_omp_array_sections): Encode low-bound into the MEM_REF,
	either into the constant offset, or for variable low-bound
	using POINTER_PLUS_EXPR.
	(c_finish_omp_clauses): Look through POINTER_PLUS_EXPR
	for array section reductions.

	* c-parser.c (c_parser_omp_declare_target): Call c_finish_omp_clauses
	in the parenthesized extended-list syntax case.
	* c-decl.c (c_decl_attributes): Don't diagnose block scope vars inside
	declare target.
	* c-typeck.c (c_finish_omp_clauses): Diagnose the same var or function
	appearing multiple times on the same directive.  Fix up wording for
	the to clause if t is neither a FUNCTION_DECL nor a VAR_DECL.
