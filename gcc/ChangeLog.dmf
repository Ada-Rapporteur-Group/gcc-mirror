==================== Branch work146-dmf, patch #108 ====================

Add saturating subtract built-ins.

This patch adds support for a saturating subtract built-in function that may be
added to a future PowerPC processor.  Note, if it is added, the name of the
built-in function may change before GCC 13 is released.  If the name changes,
we will submit a patch changing the name.

I also added support for providing dense math built-in functions, even though
at present, we have not added any new built-in functions for dense math.  It is
likely we will want to add new dense math built-in functions as the dense math
support is fleshed out.

The patches have been tested on both little and big endian systems.  Can I check
it into the master branch?

==================== Branch work146-dmf, patch #107 ====================

Support load/store vector with right length.

This patch adds support for new instructions that may be added to the PowerPC
architecture in the future to enhance the load and store vector with length
instructions.

The current instructions (lxvl, lxvll, stxvl, and stxvll) are inconvient to use
since the count for the number of bytes must be in the top 8 bits of the GPR
register, instead of the bottom 8 bits.  This meant that code generating these
instructions typically had to do a shift left by 56 bits to get the count into
the right position.  In a future version of the PowerPC architecture, new
variants of these instructions might be added that expect the count to be in
the bottom 8 bits of the GPR register.  These patches add this support to GCC
if the user uses the -mcpu=future option.

I discovered that the code in rs6000-string.cc to generate ISA 3.1 lxvl/stxvl
future lxvll/stxvll instructions would generate these instructions on 32-bit.
However the patterns for these instructions is only done on 64-bit systems.  So
I added a check for 64-bit support before generating the instructions.

The patches have been tested on both little and big endian systems.  Can I check
it into the master branch?

==================== Branch work146-dmf, patch #106 ====================

PowerPC: Add support for 1,024 bit DMR registers.

This patch is a prelimianry patch to add the full 1,024 bit dense math register
(DMRs) for -mcpu=future.  The MMA 512-bit accumulators map onto the top of the
DMR register.

This patch only adds the new 1,024 bit register support.  It does not add
support for any instructions that need 1,024 bit registers instead of 512 bit
registers.

I used the new mode 'TDOmode' to be the opaque mode used for 1,204 bit
registers.  The 'wD' constraint added in previous patches is used for these
registers.  I added support to do load and store of DMRs via the VSX registers,
since there are no load/store dense math instructions.  I added the new keyword
'__dmr' to create 1,024 bit types that can be loaded into DMRs.  At present, I
don't have aliases for __dmr512 and __dmr1024 that we've discussed internally.

The patches have been tested on both little and big endian systems.  Can I check
it into the master branch?

==================== Branch work146-dmf, patch #103 ====================

PowerPC: Add support for accumulators in DMR registers.

The MMA subsystem added the notion of accumulator registers as an optional
feature of ISA 3.1 (power10).  In ISA 3.1, these accumulators overlapped with
the traditional floating point registers 0..31, but logically the accumulator
registers were separate from the FPR registers.  In ISA 3.1, it was anticipated
that in future systems, the accumulator registers may no overlap with the FPR
registers.  This patch adds the support for dense math registers as separate
registers.

This particular patch does not change the MMA support to use the accumulators
within the dense math registers.  This patch just adds the basic support for
having separate DMRs.  The next patch will switch the MMA support to use the
accumulators if -mcpu=future is used.

For testing purposes, I added an undocumented option '-mdense-math' to enable
or disable the dense math support.

This patch adds a new constraint (wD).  If MMA is selected but dense math is
not selected (i.e. -mcpu=power10), the wD constraint will allow access to
accumulators that overlap with the VSX vector registers 0..31.  If both MMA and
dense math are selected (i.e. -mcpu=future), the wD constraint will only allow
dense math registers.

This patch modifies the existing %A output modifier.  If MMA is selected but
dense math is not selected, then %A output modifier converts the VSX register
number to the accumulator number, by dividing it by 4.  If both MMA and dense
math are selected, then %A will map the separate DMR registers into 0..7.

The intention is that user code using extended asm can be modified to run on
both MMA without dense math and MMA with dense math:

    1)	If possible, don't use extended asm, but instead use the MMA built-in
	functions;

    2)	If you do need to write extended asm, change the d constraints
	targetting accumulators should now use wD;

    3)	Only use the built-in zero, assemble and disassemble functions create
	move data between vector quad types and dense math accumulators.
	I.e. do not use the xxmfacc, xxmtacc, and xxsetaccz directly in the
	extended asm code.  The reason is these instructions assume there is a
	1-to-1 correspondence between 4 adjacent FPR registers and an
	accumulator that overlaps with those instructions.  With accumulators
	now being separate registers, there no longer is a 1-to-1
	correspondence.

It is possible that the mangling for DMRs and the GDB register numbers may
change in the future.

PowerPC: Make -mcpu=future enable -mblock-ops-vector-pair.

This patch re-enables generating load and store vector pair instructions when

During power10 development, it was determined that using store vector pair
instructions were problematical in a few cases, so we disabled generating load

PowerPC: Add -mcpu=future.

This patch implements support for a potential future PowerPC cpu.  Features
added with -mcpu=future, may or may not be added to new PowerPC processors.

This patch adds support for the -mcpu=future option.  If you use -mcpu=future,
the macro __ARCH_PWR_FUTURE__ is defined, and the assembler .machine directive
"future" is used.  Future patches in this series will add support for new
instructions that may be present in future PowerPC processors.

This particular patch does not any new features.  It exists as a ground work
for future patches to support for a possible PowerPC processor in the future.

This patch does not implement any differences in tuning when -mcpu=future is
used compared to -mcpu=power10.  If -mcpu=future is used, GCC will use power10
tuning.  If you explicitly use -mtune=future, you will get a warning that
-mtune=future is not supported, and default tuning will be set for power10.

==================== Branch work146-dmf, patch #1 (main branch) ====================

Power10: Add options to disable load and store vector pair.

This is version 2 of the patch to add -mno-load-vector-pair and
-mno-store-vector-pair undocumented tuning switches.

The differences between the first version of the patch and this version is that
I added explicit RTL abi attributes for when the compiler can generate the load
vector pair and store vector pair instructions.  By having this attribute, the
movoo insn has separate alternatives for when we generate the instruction and
when we want to split the instruction into 2 separate vector loads or stores.

In the first version of the patch, I had previously provided built-in functions
that would always generate load vector pair and store vector pair instructions
even if these instructions are normally disabled.  I found these built-ins
weren't specified like the other vector pair built-ins, and I didn't include
documentation for the built-in functions.  If we want such built-in functions,
we can add them as a separate patch later.

In addition, since both versions of the patch adds #pragma target and attribute
support to change the results for individual functions, we can select on a
function by function basis what the defaults for load/store vector pair is.

The original text for the patch is:

In working on some future patches that involve utilizing vector pair
instructions, I wanted to be able to tune my program to enable or disable using
the vector pair load or store operations while still keeping the other
operations on the vector pair.

This patch adds two undocumented tuning options.  The -mno-load-vector-pair
option would tell GCC to generate two load vector instructions instead of a
single load vector pair.  The -mno-store-vector-pair option would tell GCC to
generate two store vector instructions instead of a single store vector pair.

If either -mno-load-vector-pair is used, GCC will not generate the indexed
stxvpx instruction.  Similarly if -mno-store-vector-pair is used, GCC will not
generate the indexed lxvpx instruction.  The reason for this is to enable
splitting the {,p}lxvp or {,p}stxvp instructions after reload without needing a
scratch GPR register.

The default for -mcpu=power10 is that both load vector pair and store vector
pair are enabled.

I added code so that the user code can modify these settings using either a
'#pragma GCC target' directive or used __attribute__((__target__(...))) in the
function declaration.

I added tests for the switches, #pragma, and attribute options.

I have built this on both little endian power10 systems and big endian power9
systems doing the normal bootstrap and test.  There were no regressions in any
of the tests, and the new tests passed.  Can I check this patch into the master
branch?
