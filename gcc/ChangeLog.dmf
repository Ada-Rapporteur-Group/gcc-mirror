==================== Branch work198-dmf, patch #102 ====================

RFC2653-PowerPC: Add support for 1,024 bit DMR registers.

This patch is a prelimianry patch to add the full 1,024 bit dense math register
(DMRs) for -mcpu=future.  The MMA 512-bit accumulators map onto the top of the
DMR register.

This patch only adds the new 1,024 bit register support.  It does not add
support for any instructions that need 1,024 bit registers instead of 512 bit
registers.

I used the new mode 'TDOmode' to be the opaque mode used for 1,024 bit
registers.  The 'wD' constraint added in previous patches is used for these
registers.  I added support to do load and store of DMRs via the VSX registers,
since there are no load/store dense math instructions.  I added the new keyword
'__dmr' to create 1,024 bit types that can be loaded into DMRs.  At present, I
don't have aliases for __dmr512 and __dmr1024 that we've discussed internally.

The patches have been tested on both little and big endian systems.  Can I check
it into the master branch?

==================== Branch work198-dmf, patch #101 ====================

RFC2653-Add support for dense math registers.

The MMA subsystem added the notion of accumulator registers as an optional
feature of ISA 3.1 (power10).  In ISA 3.1, these accumulators overlapped with
the VSX registers 0..31, but logically the accumulator registers were separate
from the FPR registers.  In ISA 3.1, it was anticipated that in future systems,
the accumulator registers may no overlap with the FPR registers.  This patch
adds the support for dense math registers as separate registers.

This particular patch does not change the MMA support to use the accumulators
within the dense math registers.  This patch just adds the basic support for
having separate DMRs.  The next patch will switch the MMA support to use the
accumulators if -mcpu=future is used.

For testing purposes, I added an undocumented option '-mdense-math' to enable
or disable the dense math support.

This patch updates the wD constraint added in the previous patch.  If MMA is
selected but dense math is not selected (i.e. -mcpu=power10), the wD constraint
will allow access to accumulators that overlap with VSX registers 0..31.  If
both MMA and dense math are selected (i.e. -mcpu=future), the wD constraint
will only allow dense math registers.

This patch modifies the existing %A output modifier.  If MMA is selected but
dense math is not selected, then %A output modifier converts the VSX register
number to the accumulator number, by dividing it by 4.  If both MMA and dense
math are selected, then %A will map the separate DMR registers into 0..7.

The intention is that user code using extended asm can be modified to run on
both MMA without dense math and MMA with dense math:

    1)	If possible, don't use extended asm, but instead use the MMA built-in
	functions;

    2)	If you do need to write extended asm, change the d constraints
	targetting accumulators should now use wD;

    3)	Only use the built-in zero, assemble and disassemble functions create
	move data between vector quad types and dense math accumulators.
	I.e. do not use the xxmfacc, xxmtacc, and xxsetaccz directly in the
	extended asm code.  The reason is these instructions assume there is a
	1-to-1 correspondence between 4 adjacent FPR registers and an
	accumulator that overlaps with those instructions.  With accumulators
	now being separate registers, there no longer is a 1-to-1
	correspondence.

It is possible that the mangling for DMRs and the GDB register numbers may
produce other changes in the future.

==================== Branch work198-dmf, patch #100 ====================

RFC2653-Add wD constraint.

This patch adds a new constraint ('wD') that matches the accumulator registers
that overlap with VSX registers 0..31 on power10.  Future patches will add the
support for a separate accumulator register class that will be used when the
support for dense math registes is added.
