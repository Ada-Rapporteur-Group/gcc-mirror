# TODO lots of testing ;-)
# crtbegin.o and crtend.o are compiled including -finhibit-size-directive.
# As the name implies, this means we don't emit the .size directive.
# For morello that's a problem, since the CAPINIT relocation should be made
# against a symbol that has a size (otherwise the linker does not know what
# bounds to put on the capability) and there are a few functions we need the
# CAPINIT relocation against.
#
# I've looked at the emitted assembly for crtbegin.o, and AFAICS there are no
# problems that the .size directive would cause (though this kind of manual
# inspection is very error-prone).  So we're overriding that command line flag
# for now.
#
# TODO It would be nice to only use this flag when building purecap crtstuff.c
# Doesn't seem worth the effort to look into right now.
