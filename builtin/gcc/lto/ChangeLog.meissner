	* lto-lang.c (def_builtin_1): Delete old interface with two
	parallel arrays to hold standard builtin declarations, and replace
	it with a function based interface that can support creating
	builtins on the fly in the future.  Change all uses, and poison
	the old names.  Make sure 0 is not a legitimate builtin index.
