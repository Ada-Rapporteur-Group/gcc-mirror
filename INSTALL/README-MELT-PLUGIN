Short installation instructions for MELT as a plugin to an installed
gcc-4.5

See also http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/MELT and http://gcc-melt.org/

If installing MELT as plugin to some existing gcc-4.5 installation tree:

   Read carefully the build-melt-plugin.sh perhaps in contrib/

   Read it again.

To prepare a source tree of the MELT plugin, read and run
contrib/make-melt-source-tar.sh from the GCC MELT branch.

If you have downloaded the MELT plugin source tree (and not
the entire GCC MELT branch) you probably can build the melt.so plugin
for GCC 4.5 in its source directory, by running something like 

env GCC=gcc-4.5 ./build-melt-plugin.sh -M $PWD -Y gt-melt-runtime-plugin-4.5.h
